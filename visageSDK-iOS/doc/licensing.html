<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p>By having any Visage Technologies Program, or part of it, installed or copied on your computer, you agree to the terms
of the <a href="../license.txt"><em>Visage Technologies AB Software License Agreement</em></a>. If you do not agree with these terms,
please entirely remove any Visage Technologies Programs from your computer.</br></br>
This section focuses on technical issues such as obtaining and using the license key files. For detailed commercial
conditions please <a href="http://www.visagetechnologies.com/contact/" target="New">contact Visage Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>Applications developed using visage|SDK must be licensed in order to function. Licensing is based on License Key Files. A single License Key File is valid for one or more installations on one or more platforms (operating systems). The License Key File can be opened in a text editor in order to read the licensing information, but it is important not to change the file in any way as it would become invalid.</p>


<p>Applications without a valid license key will still function, but tracking time shall be limited to one minute and appropriate
warning messages shall be displayed.</p>

<h2>Obtaining the License Key File</h2>

<p>For 30-day evaluation, simply send an email request to your Visage Technologies contact person and you will receive a License Key File by email.</p>

<p>If you are purchasing a license, please decide on your <b>App's Bundle Identifier</b> and send it to your Visage Technologies
contact person together with your purchase order. In return, you will receive a License Key File by email.</p>



<h2><a class="anchor" id="include_license"></a>Including the License Key File in your application</h2>

<ol>
<p> <li>Add the License Key File to the <b>Resources</b> group of your <b>Xcode project</b>. This can be done by dragging and dropping the License Key File in the <b>Resources</b> group. If the <b>Resources</b> group doesn't exist, it should be created beforehand. </li> <br>
<li>In your application, you need to call the initialization function in order to let the Application read the License Key File. This is done as follows in your application code: </li>
<pre>
	// necessary prototype declaration for licensing
	namespace VisageSDK {
		void initializeLicenseManager(const char *licenseKeyFileName);
	}
	
	//...
	
	//initialize licensing
	initializeLicenseManager("name-of-the-license-file.vlc");

</pre>

where "name-of-the-license-file.vlc" is the name of your License Key File. The above example expects the License Key
File to be in the root folder of the application bundle. </li>
</p>

<p>
<li>In the Sample projects the licensing code is already inserted, so you just need to change the license key file name when you obtain the license key file. Specifically:<br/> </li>
<br/> <ol>
In the <b>Visage Tracker Demo</b> sample project the licensing code is found in the <i>initTracker</i> method, in the <i>TrackerWrapper.mm</i> file.<br/>
<br/>

In the <b>Visage Tracker Unity Demo</b> sample project and the <b>Facial Animation Unity Demo</b> sample project, the licensing code is found in the in <i>_initTracker</i> function, in the <i>VisageTrackerUnityPlugin.mm</i> file. It is necessary to rebuild the VisageTrackerUnityPlugin project when you change the license key file name.
<br>
<br/>
In the <b>Face Detect Demo</b> sample project, the licensing code is found in the <i>initTracker</i> method, in the <i>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.mm</i> file.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
</ol>
</ol>
<b>NOTE:</b>  In case you receive error message that App Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load, please set the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads key to YES under NSAppTransportSecurity dictionary in your .plist file <br/> <br/>

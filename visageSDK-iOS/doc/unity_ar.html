<h1>Visage Tracker Unity Demo sample project</h1>

<p>
The VisageTrackerUnityDemo sample project demonstrates the integration of visage|SDK with Unity game engine and
is aimed at developers starting to use face tracking functionality of visage|SDK in Unity game engine and development
tool.
</p>
<p>
The sample project shows how face tracking is used to put virtual object (glasses) on the user’s face in Unity. Developers may use parts of this project to speed up their own
development in Unity using visage|SDK or use this application as a starting point for own projects.
</p>

<h2>Building and running the project</h2>

<p>
The files related to VisageTrackerUnityDemo sample project are located in the Samples/iOS/VisageTrackerUnityDemo
subfolder of the visage|SDK for iOS folder.<br/><br/>
Prerequisites to running the sample project are:
<ul>
<li>Xcode (version 7.x+)</li>
<li>Unity (version 5.0.x+)</li>
<li>iOS device (iPhone 6 or iPad 4 recommended; iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s work with reduced performance)</li>
</ul>

To build and run VisageTrackerUnityDemo sample two steps are involved: creating the Unity project from the provided
Unity package and generating and modifying the Xcode project from Unity. These tasks are executed semi - automatically.<br/><br/>

<b>NOTE:</b> The Visage Tracker Unity plugin for iOS will not work in Unity editor, it will only work on actual device.

</p>

<h3>Step 1. Creating the Unity project from Unity package</h3>

<p>
To create the Unity project from provided Unity package follow these steps:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Open Unity</li><br/>
<li>Create a new Unity project</li><br/>
<li>Import <b>VisageTrackerUnityDemo.unitypackage</b> that is provided in the Samples/iOS/VisageTrackerUnityDemo folder. <br/> This is done in 
Unity by
selecting Assets->Import Package->Custom Package... item from the menu. That way all the assets that
are used by the example project will be imported into the new project.</li><br/>
<li>Select and open the Main scene, located in Project's Assets.</li><br/>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Step 2. Generating the Xcode project from Unity</h3>
<p>
To generate the Xcode project for this sample follow these steps:<br/>
<ol>
<li>In Unity, select <b> File->Build settings...</b> A new window will appear. Switch the platform to iOS and add the current scene.</li> <br/>
<li>Open the player settings by pressing <b>Player Settings...</b> button.</li><br/>
<li>In <b>PlayerSettings</b> please set the Company name to "visagetechnologies", Product name to "visagetrackerunitydemo" and Bundle Identifier
to "com.visagetechnologies.visagetrackerunitydemo". Change the <b>Graphics API </b> from <b>Automatic</b> to <b>Open GL ES 2.0.</b></li> <br/>
<li>Press the Build button to generate the project, a new dialog window will appear. In this window, locate and set
destination folder to <b>Samples/iOS/VisageTrackerUnityDemo</b>. This generates Xcode project in that folder.</li> <br/>

 <b>NOTE:</b>  If Unity reports error during build, please double check which platform is selected in the Build settings. <br/>  <br/> 

<li>Successful build completion triggers post build processing. Folder selection dialog appears. Choose visage|SDK for iOS root folder. This modifies generated Xcode project adding additional required frameworks, data files and libraries to it.</li> <br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> Sometimes post build process can fail. In such cases add following files to Xcode project manually:<br/>
Samples/data folder by dragging and dropping them into newly created Resources
group. A dialog window will appear. In this window, select the "Create folder references for any added
folders":
<ul>
<li>Head Tracker.cfg</li>
<li>candide3.fdp</li>
<li>candide3.wfm</li>
<li>bdtsdata folder containing the additional data files</li></ul>
<br/>
Add <b>libVisageVision.a</b>, <b>libVisageCore.a</b> and <b>libVisageTrackerUnityPlugin.a</b> from visage|SDK lib folder to the Libraries folder of the generated Xcode project.
After that just drag and drop them from that folder to the Xcode project (also to the Libraries folder).  
<br/>  <br/> 
<li>Open generated Xcode project. Double check that targeted iOS device is selected as active scheme. Go to Build Settings, set iOS Deploymenet Target to 8.1 and Enable Bitcode to NO. Build the Xcode project.<br/> 
</li><br/>
<b>NOTE:</b>  Sometimes Xcode returns link error that it can't locate libiPhone-lib.a. In such cases click on Project->Build Phases-> Link Binary With Libraries, remove the libiPhone-lib.a and add it again. To add a new library click + option, a new window will appear, select Add Other...->Libraries->libiPhone-lib.a. <br/> <br/> 
<li>This step is optional. If you have a license key file, add it by dragging and dropping them into newly created Resources
group in generated Xcode project. Also, please read the section <a href="licensing.html#include_license">Including the License Key File in your application</a> in the Registration and Licensing page.</li><br/>
<b>NOTE:</b>  In case you receive error message that App Transport Security has blocked a cleartext HTTP (http://) resource load, please set the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads key to YES under NSAppTransportSecurity dictionary in your .plist file <br/> <br/> 
</ol>

</p>

<h2>Using the sample app</h2>
<p>
When the application starts there is a button in the upper left corner of the application: Track from camera. When the button
is pressed and when a face is found in the camera frame, tracking starts. On top of the video frames is a 3D model of glasses that is transformed with
the information about rotation and translation from the tracker. It blends seamlessly with the background video.
</p>
<p>
	<b> NOTE:</b>  Without the valid License Key tracking will stop after 1 minute. Appropriate message will appear on the screen to inform the user before the start of the tracking and after the tracking time expires. 
</p>


<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<p>
The project consists of a main scene with the Unity’s GameObjects that provide different functionalities. A GameObject
is the main building block of a scene in Unity. It consists of different Components and can parent other GameObjects.
Manipulation of GameObjects is done with Scripts. It is recommended for developers to get familiar with Unity basics
before continuing. The integration with visage|SDK is done through a plugin (VisageTrackerUnityPlugin) that wraps
native code calls to visage|SDK and provides functions that can be called from Unity scripts.
</p>

<h3>Configuration selection</h3>
<p>
Tracker.cs contains the code for device-specific selection of tracking configuration, ensuring optimal tracking performance on different devices by taking into account their performance, camera and screen characteristics. Please read more details about configuration selection in the section <a href="creatingxc.html#config_selection">Device-specific configuration selection</a>.
</p>

<h3>Tracker GameObject</h3>
<p>
The core of the example is the Tracker GameObject. It consists of different components attached to it. The main
component of the Tracker GameObject is the Tracker script component that handles the communication with the tracker
(starts it and gets results from it). The behavior of the script can be modified by changing its properties and the script
code. Other properties can be added as well. The existing Tracker script properties of interest are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Controllable Objects: list of objects that will be transformed automatically while the face tracking is performed</li>
<li>Config File: filename of the configuration file that will be used by the tracker</li>
</ul>

<b>NOTE:</b> Because of the different coordinate systems used by the visage|SDK face tracker and the Unity game engine
mirroring around x-axis is applied to the relevant GameObjects.<br/><br/>
Object in the scene that is also in the Controllable Objects list is the GlassesModel GameObject.
</p>

<h3>Cameras</h3>
<p>
There are two cameras in the scene, one for 3D scene (Main Camera) and other for video display (Video Camera).
The main camera "Field of View" is automatically set according to the Tracker focus (camera_focus parameter in
configuration file) and input image aspect by the Tracker script. The Video Camera renders objects in the Video layer
by using orthographic projection.
</p>

<h3>Video object</h3>
<p>
Video GameObject contains Video Plane that is used for displaying video and is automatically scaled to input frame
aspect ratio by the <a href="html/doc/VideoController.txt">VideoController</a> script attached to it.
</p>

<h3>Glasses object</h3>
<p>
Since the Glasses object is in the Tracker script Controllable Objects list, rotation and translation information from the tracker is applied to it. This enables the overlaying of virtual objects to the tracked face that transform correctly with
it. Other custom objects can be used instead of the glasses object. For a more comprehensive guide on how to achieve occlusion or 
on how to properly introduce other objects to the scene see <a href="modeling_guide.pdf" target="_blank">AR modeling guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="uniplug" ></a> VisageTrackerUnityPlugin</h3>
<p>
The integration of visage|SDK face tracking with Unity is done through a plugin that wraps native code calls and
provides functions that can be called from Unity scripts. The provided prebuilt plugin VisageTrackerUnityPlugin.a can
be used as-is. The project and the source code for the VisageTrackerUnityPlugin plugin are also provided and can be
used to implement different functionality if needed. For more information about the plugin including it's source code, see the <a href="unity_plugin.html">VisageTrackerUnityPlugin</a> project and its documentation.
